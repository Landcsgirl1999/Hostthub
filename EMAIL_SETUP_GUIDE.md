# ðŸ“§ Email Setup Guide for Consultation Notifications

## Current Status

Your consultation system is now working with email notifications instead of Google Calendar integration. When someone books a consultation, the system will:

1. **Log the consultation details** to the console
2. **Generate email content** for both admin and client
3. **Track analytics** for the booking

## What You'll See in the Console

When someone books a consultation, you'll see output like this:

```
=== ADMIN EMAIL ===
To: sierra.reynolds@hostit.com
Subject: New Consultation Request - Hostit Consultation - John Doe
Content: [Full email content with consultation details]
==================

=== CLIENT EMAIL ===
To: john.doe@example.com
Subject: Consultation Confirmation - Hostit.com
Content: [Confirmation email content]
==================

Consultation scheduled: {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  date: '2025-07-09',
  time: '09:00',
  method: 'phone',
  adminEmail: 'sierra.reynolds@hostit.com',
  clientEmail: 'john.doe@example.com'
}
```

## Next Steps to Send Actual Emails

To send real emails instead of just logging them, you have several options:

### Option 1: Resend.com (Recommended)
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Install: `npm install resend`
4. Update the consultation API to use Resend

### Option 2: SendGrid
1. Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Install: `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
4. Update the consultation API to use SendGrid

### Option 3: Nodemailer with Gmail
1. Install: `npm install nodemailer`
2. Set up Gmail app password
3. Update the consultation API to use Nodemailer

## Environment Variables to Add

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Email Service (choose one)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
# OR
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
# OR
GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASS=your_app_password

# Admin Details
ADMIN_EMAIL=sierra.reynolds@hostit.com
ADMIN_NAME=Sierra Reynolds
```

## Testing the Current System

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/consultation`
2. Fill out the form and submit
3. Check your terminal/console for the email logs
4. You should see the consultation details logged

## Benefits of This Approach
